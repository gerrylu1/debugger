- To see how well you have played, tap *Stats*. This includes the levels you have played, the kills and misses you have got, and the time you have spent on each level you played. If you remove a custom level, the game history related to that level will also be deleted.

You can also choose a background image for the level you are making. The App obtains images by using the Pixabay API. And, last but not least, don't forget to give the level a name.
